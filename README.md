# Social Distance Analysis

With the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradient) approach, a code was written to calculate social distance by detecting people, showing people who do not comply with the distance and giving a warning message.
## Results

In the Real Time Social Distance Analysis project, we aimed to solve the problem in the most practical way by researching many resources in order to show our knowledge and make the project quality. </br>
We learned brand new definitions by applying the desired designs on the image processing reference code. </br>
Most importantly, each chapter that was written emphasized the importance of thinking, struggling and developing. </br>
We also gained experience in debugging.
